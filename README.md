# OStim Community Resource
These are resources for streamlining the development and integrating OStim mods between themselves, including custom-voiced characters and gameplay mods. I want the license to be as open as possible, however I am not the author of some assets.<br>
The meshes and textures (files inside those respective folders) are used with permission of the authors and you need to consult the instructions on their webpages if you want to use it.<br>
